# 5DOF-3D-Robotic-arm
This repository includes a simplified 3D representation of a robotic arm designed with five degrees of freedom (DOF)

# Degrees of Freedom:
This robotic arm is engineered with 5 degrees of freedom, enabling a wide range of motion and flexibility:
 1. Base Rotation – Allows the entire arm to rotate around its vertical axis.
 2. Shoulder Joint – Controls the upward and downward movement of the first arm segment.
 3. Elbow Joint – Enables bending and extending of the second arm segment.
 4. Wrist Motion – Provides vertical movement of the end segment for fine positioning.
 5. Gripper Mechanism – Opens and closes the gripper to grasp or release objects.

 # How to Use:
To get started with the 5-DOF robotic arm model, follow these steps:
 1. Download the robot_arm_5dof.stl file.
 2. Import the file into TinkerCAD or any compatible 3D viewer.
 3. Refer to the arm.png image to view the labeled components and understand the structure.
 4. Simulate or 3D print the model based on your project needs.
